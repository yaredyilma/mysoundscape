			As a person immensely fascinated by <em>accents</em> and <em>sounds</em>, I have 
imagined that one day, I would dicuss <strong>the negative impacts of sounds in my life!</strong>.From the 25rd of October until the 22nd of February, my Soundscapes will come to life in the windows of sacred scenes. You are all welcome to the opening on Thursday the 24th evening, from 18:00 om.
		<p>Noise is a sound that all humans learn to ignore. Each and everyone of us grow up with listening mastery in tunning out noises from the environment, and push them into background noises as our will. Then I became a refugee and faced noises that couldn't simply be ignored.</p>

<p>Some noises posses a power to cut-through one's inner flesh, and in my tumultous stay at the refugee camp, I was stabbed countless times by mere sounds that felt like daggers. while the particular shrill whistle leaves its scar indelibly, some noises tend to be less sharp on the edge, but are insistent enough to cut deep into anyone's inner calm. 106
 people: children, teenegers, men and women of diffrent cultures bumping into each other in one space can produce so much noise! to me the centre felt as a secluded dystopia where universal deafness is considred a sane option.</p>
